# Demo: https://codepen.io/iulia/pen/gRWRJj

Create a single page web application that utilises GitHub APIs to allow a user to search for a repository by name. The application should also offer a detail view for viewing more information about a repository. This detail view should include the repository's readme, if available, and the number of open issues, number of forks, etc.
